* Data Modeling
** Space Requirements of data types
*** ENUM vs. Text
*** UUID vs. Text
Usage of text fields to keep UUIDs. Very space inefficient. uuid takes just 16 bytes, while text representation takes 37 bytes. It also proportionally increases index size.
** Index
*** Are part of data modeling task
**** FK
**** Partial Index
useful for low cardinality columns with sked distribution
