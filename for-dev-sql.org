#+TITLE: SQL Performance for Developers
* Getting to know?
** Who has used OFFSET for pagination?
** Who knows how to apply denormalization? (3NF)
** Who likes statistics?
** Contents
- applies to relational dbs
- details and commands will vary
- which change the row
- contrast to LSM Trees
* Why are queries slow?
** Always use Index?
*** Removing index access made it faster
even with SSD index and base table is more data to process than the base table alone.
** we read to much data from disk
improve performance by reducing IO
** How do indexes Help here?
* How a database executes a query
** There is no magic
magic does not exist
** how to read data
rows is data stored in files

how to find the row in the file the user asked for?

Sequential read whole file (O(n))
use an index, get the position, read the file from that position
** discuss output of explain
on simple example seq scan
- discuss output of explain!!!
  - costs
  - time
  - width
** where does the costs come from?
- cost model
*** administration
set statistics_target in postgres
*** What are the limitations?
**** Extreme distributions or many rows
**** correlated columns
They are actually a design error (Normal Form violation).
* Indexes
Can we do better the sequential scan?  (reference to the example)
** What is it?
*** Specific data structure
*** Allocates space on disk
*** holds redundant information
*** CREATE INDEX own syntax
** What is it for CS?
*** Search tree
*** double linked list
we can read it in both directions.
*** Leaf nodes hold reference to the address of the row
*** Tree structure enables to find the leaf fast
** Btree index
** Index Access
*** Search the tree
*** Follow the leafs
*** Load the rows the table
this may require loading a lot of pages

How many rows are in a page?
*** How many blocks do we load
upper bound depends on the high of the index

compared to table scan we read much less blocks
**** Range scan
in case of range scan number of accessed blocks depends on the physical
proximity.

Administrator can influence that.  CLUSTER command

** At which cost?
what does it cost to update the index?

HOT updateso
* How to leverage the index?
What information could we use to select the proper index?

- columns in the where clause
- operator used in where clause
- columns in order by
** Column in where clause with literal value
- show wrong example
- show analyze
- discuss no index usage
- assignment: fix it and check explain
*** TODO implicit conversion may introduce a funcion application
  strType=intType (I was not able to create an example in postgres)
** Column where clause an volatile fn
see example in 1.sql
*** TODO what is the difference between stable and immutable?
** Use index for range scan

** Usage of multicolumn index matters
- Shall we discuss the order of columns in respect to cardinality?
** Index usage in ~order by~ clause
*** also for TOP-N query
** LIKE operator
- depends on Locale and index operator class
- for literal values only
- Postgres and Binding parameter may not work
- sql injection
** Index-Only Scan
** Pagination and OFFSET
scalability
** Join?  HashJoin
** Correlated attributes example
** Summary
Which types of access nodes we have seen?
What is important to check in explain plan? (number of execution steps, costs, rows, width)
Which important patterns/mistakes?
* Create Index
** Which indexes
 btree, hash, gist, spgist, gin, and brin
*** TODO What are differences?
what are gin and gist indexes for?
** Development task
** Syntax
** Delete and FK
** Usecase partial index
* Data Modeling
** Space Requirements of data types
*** ENUM vs. Text
*** UUID vs. Text
Usage of text fields to keep UUIDs. Very space inefficient. uuid takes just 16 bytes, while text representation takes 37 bytes. It also proportionally increases index size.
** Rowheader Overhead
24 bytes per row
Null value bitmap (see valentines slide)
** Toast
** CTID might not be unique
* Other topics
** hook up seq scan
postgres only
